	<h1>String Gauge Basics</h1>
	<p></p>
		<ul>
			<li>There are various string gauges commonly in use for stringing your guitar.  Typically they range from .010 to .013 for a high 'E' string, and the rest of the set is generally scaled based on the gauge of the high 'E' string.</li>
			<li>Hybrid sets are also available which use lighter gauges on the upper strings and heavier gauges on the lower strings.  These are specialty and not common.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>String Gauge In Depth</h2>
	<p></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lighter gauges allow you to have lower action on the guitar</li>
			<li>Heavier gauges require you to have higher action to avoid fret-buzz</li>
			<li>Lighter gauge strings have a 'thinner' tone</li>
			<li>Heavier gauge strings have a 'fatter' tone</li>	
			<li>Lighter gauge strings are easier to bend and play</li>
			<li>Heavier gauge strings are harder to bend and play</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Conclusions</h3>
	<p>String gauge is a matter of personal preference and pain tolerance vs. tone</p>

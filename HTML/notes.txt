HTML isn't a turing language on it's own (requires javaScript, cgi to complete)

DOM = Document Object Model

Meta Data
Header
Body
Footer

HTML is 'the object that is the form'

difference between .htm and .html (legacy from 8.3 format)

<!DOCTYPE HTML>    (Use WC3 Validator!)

Put non-essential script declarations at the bottom (footer), not in the header - browser waits to load scripts located in the header, which slows down page load
